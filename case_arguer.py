The Claimant respectfully submits that the dismissal was both procedurally and substantively unfair:

**LEGAL FRAMEWORK:**
The Employment Act, 2007 provides comprehensive protection for employees against unfair dismissal. Section 45(2) prohibits unfair termination, while Section 41 mandates fair procedure.

**PROCEDURAL UNFAIRNESS:**
The disciplinary process failed to comply with Section 41 of the Employment Act, 2007:
- Inadequate notice of allegations
- Denial of proper representation
- Failure to follow fair hearing procedures

**SUBSTANTIVE UNFAIRNESS:**
The reasons advanced for dismissal were not valid, fair, or sufficient under Section 44 of the Employment Act:
- No clear evidence of misconduct
- Disproportionate response to alleged offense
- Failure to consider mitigating circumstances

**BURDEN OF PROOF:**
The Respondent bears the burden of proving fair dismissal under Section 43 of the Employment Act. This burden has not been discharged.

**RELIEF SOUGHT:**
- Declaration that dismissal was unfair
- One month's salary in lieu of notice
- Compensation for unfair dismissal (up to 12 months gross salary)
- Costs of the suit

The Claimant seeks justice and fair compensation for the wrongful termination.

**EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT:**
Clear and cogent evidence demonstrates:
- The employee's misconduct

The Respondent respectfully submits that the claim should be dismissed with costs.
